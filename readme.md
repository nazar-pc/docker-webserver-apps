# WebServer apps
This repository will contain carefully crafted images that are intended to be used with `nazarpc/webserver:*`  family of images.
The main intention of creating WebServer was to create set of separate stateless images that work nicely together, while each separate container have only single responsibility.

This repository is the next step forward to provide automated installation of useful applications by simple one-time plugging of container to your WebServer setup.
