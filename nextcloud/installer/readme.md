NextCloud installer based on `nazarpc/webserver:php-fpm`.
Is use only once for installation by linking with data container and database.
Contains NextCloud distributive, MySQL/MariaDB config, Nginx config and does almost all initial configuration automatically.
All you need to do afterwards is just go to Web UI and type login and password for NextCloud administrator. Yes, that simple.
